1.What is the purpose of the "Applied Steps" pane in Power Query?
  Track transformations â€“ It provides a step-by-step record of every action youâ€™ve done (e.g., removing columns, filtering rows, changing data types).

Transparency â€“ You can see how your data was cleaned or shaped, making the process reproducible.

Edit or delete steps â€“ Each step can be modified, renamed, reordered, or removed if you want to adjust the process.

Debugging â€“ If something goes wrong (e.g., a column disappears or data type errors occur), you can trace back which step caused the issue.

Automation â€“ Since Power Query records steps as M-code in the background, the same transformations will reapply automatically when new data is loaded.

2.How do you remove duplicate rows in Power Query?
  Open your table in Power Query Editor.

Select the column(s) you want to check for duplicates.

If you select one column â†’ duplicates are checked only in that column.

If you select multiple columns â†’ duplicates are removed only if all selected column values are the same.

Go to the Home tab â†’ click Remove Rows â†’ choose Remove Duplicates.
3.What does the "Filter" icon do in Power Query?
  Filter rows â€“ lets you keep only the rows that meet certain conditions.

For text: you can choose specific values (e.g., only "USA" or "Canada").

For numbers/dates: you can set conditions (e.g., greater than 100, after 01/01/2024).

Create a filter step â€“ when you apply a filter, Power Query records it as a new step (Filtered Rows) in the Applied Steps pane.

Dynamic filtering â€“ the filter updates automatically whenever you refresh the data source.

  4.How would you rename a column from "CustID" to "CustomerID"?

   Using the interface (easy way)

In Power Query Editor, right-click the column header CustID.

Select Rename.

Type CustomerID and press Enter.

  5.What happens if you click "Close & Apply" in Power Query?

  Close â€“ Power Query Editor window closes.

Apply â€“ All the transformation steps you created (in the Applied Steps pane) are applied to the data.

The transformed data is loaded into Power BIâ€™s data model.

The queries are refreshed, meaning Power BI pulls the latest data from the source and applies your steps.

  6.Remove all rows where Quantity is less than 2.
Using the interface:

In Power Query Editor, click the filter icon on the Quantity column.

Choose Number Filters â†’ Greater Than or Equal Toâ€¦

Enter 2.

Press OK.

  7.Split the OrderDate column into separate "Year," "Month," and "Day" columns.
  Using the interface (easy way):

Select the OrderDate column.

Go to the Add Column tab â†’ Date group.

Choose:

Year â†’ Year (creates a Year column).

Month â†’ Month (creates a Month column).

Day â†’ Day (creates a Day column).

Rename the new columns if needed.

8.Replace all "Mouse" entries in the Product column with "Computer Mouse."

. Using the interface (easy way):

Select the Product column.

Go to the Transform tab â†’ click Replace Values.

In the dialog:

Value To Find = Mouse

Replace With = Computer Mouse

Click OK.

9.Sort the table by OrderDate (newest first).
  Using the interface:

In Power Query Editor, click the drop-down (â–¼) on the OrderDate column header.

Choose Sort Descending.
ðŸ‘‰ This will place the most recent dates at the top.

A step called Sorted Rows will appear in the Applied Steps pane.

  10.Remove rows with null values

Select the Price column.

Go to Home â†’ Remove Rows â†’ Remove Blank Rows.
ðŸ‘‰ This deletes any rows where Price is null.
  11.Write custom M-code to add a column calculating TotalSpent = Quantity * Price.

In Power Query (M-code), you can add a custom column that multiplies Quantity Ã— Price to calculate TotalSpent.

  12.Home menyusida Group By tugmasini bosing.

Group by sifatida CustID ustunini tanlang.

Operation sifatida Sum ni tanlang.

Qiymatini hisoblash uchun TotalSpent (yoki Quantity * Price natijasi) ustunini belgilang.

Yangi ustun nomini yozing, masalan: CustomerTotalSpent.
  13.Fix inconsistent date formats (e.g., 01/10/2023 vs. 2023-01-10) in OrderDate.
  OrderDate ustunini tanlang.

Transform â†’ Data Type â†’ Date ni tanlang.

Power Query sanalarni avtomatik tarzda bir xil formatga (odatda yyyy-mm-dd) oâ€˜tkazadi.

Agar Power Query xatolik bersa, Using Locale usulini ishlating:

Transform â†’ Data Type â†’ Date â†’ Using Locale.

Masalan: Date â†’ English (United States) yoki kerakli til/mamlakatni tanlang.

Bu bilan sanalar aniq format boâ€˜yicha oâ€˜qiladi.

  14.Create a conditional column: Label orders as "High Value" if Price > 100.

  Add Column â†’ Conditional Column tugmasini bosing.

Ustun tanlang: Price.

Shart qoâ€˜ying: is greater than 100.

Output: High Value.

Else: null (yoki "Normal Value" deb yozishingiz mumkin).
  15.Optimize the query to reduce refresh time (e.g., remove unused columns early).

  maâ€™lumotni iloji boricha kichraytirib oling (ustun/qatorlarni erta olib tashlash), datatypeâ€™larni oxirda bering, merge/sort/groupâ€™larni ehtiyotkorlik bilan ishlating.
